    <h2>Don't Pontificate too Much</h2>

    <p>I need to re-evaluate. Someone told me that contemplating life during a euphoric moment then writing ones thoughts is an exercise in futility. Any idiot can pontificate about her opinion on life and culture and death and art and war and what it is that really matters when we are wrapped up in all this shit. Like I said before, we can convince ourselves of our greatness when we feel majestic and unstoppable but when we’ve finished filling our mouth and mind with the endless shit that is life, how do we feel about our art when we step back and look at it. Sick? Disgusted? You bet. My levelheaded mind says, “You suck. I hate you. Why did you do that. Did she see what you did? I hope not.” Anyways, on to things of more importance.</p>

    <p>When I kiss a girl does she feel what I feel? I’m fairly certain that I’ve kissed women that were more affected by the kiss than myself; boy do you think you’re special, maybe it was the opposite you fool. Not a new thought at all, but why does touching our input/output device seem to illicit such strong emotions? I say something, she smiles and replies, I laugh in return, a slight touch, knees and elbows and perhaps hands a little, eventually when the moment is right our lips touch and we explore one another physically, but only after the mental journey. How does that work? Fuck if I know.</p>

    <p>I can hardly understand what it means to be nice and good and do the right thing. What is it to love? To partake in activities I am not interested in? Or is it the flip side. To have such desire and drive to push the said actions forward. She told me she loved me and I shrugged in apathetic response when really it, perhaps, mattered. And so I fucked it again. Another one, her heart slightly smaller, mine as well. Why... I think I should ask, but for reasons I cannot grasp in the slightest, I am just fine. If anything I’m happy, the weight is gone, there is no question anymore and it is easy, I am not worried. I’m Winnie the Pooh wandering around trying to decide who to visit as I enjoy the brook in the forest and the birds chirping and the butterflies floating. They are beautiful and I am hungry but I didn’t bring a jar of honey so I’m spot out of luck. Another day out in the woods and I’m happy, but am I really? There is a person back there, not
too far, just beyond the small hill I’m walking down and he is watching and waiting. He has ideas of his own that are not mine, they amount to more than I could ever think to be. A harbinger of things to come, and the ways in which I feel inadequate he seems to be cataloging, each item on a list in his little book he marks down and then thinks about how we shall solve that. I imagine that he believes in much more than I do, in things that matter, in ideas that have purpose and unconditional love and dying for those who do not deserve such compassion.</p>

    <p>I was talking to a man once. He was older than me, or at least I thought he was but actually he was younger than myself, and he asked what I thought about my life and if there was something I was fit for or destined to do. I had told him no or maybe that I didn’t know and he had gone off on a tirade about Jesus and Christ and some father that wasn’t the one I knew, but eventually he started talking about relationships and how if I had a special one I might be happy one day and that I might not actually die. I wasn’t paying much attention to him, he had lost me at the Christ part, but when he said I didn’t have to die I sat up straight and asked him why he thought I shouldn’t need die. He replied that love was why I wasn’t going to die and I agreed with him, it was true, even if everything he said was crazy and false it did not matter because like he said, there is love. LOVE. No, Love. Better. Yeah, it’s love apparently. My mom says she loves me and I believe her and its more true than anything I’ve experienced in this life, she couldn’t be more right. But do I get to live forever because of her love for me? Nope. I told this guy to fuck right off and to take his “its all crazy and its all love” ideas to some other pathetic loser who is too sad and easy and willing to lap it all up. When I was done speaking to him and the anger and hurt that I pushed onto him subsided and he was done absorbing it he gave me a look that touched my soul. And it was in that moment that I saw that the love of my mother resided in him, and it was for me, and it was more powerful and pure than anything my mother had for me. How could that be? It was illogical, my brain couldn’t compute and I fell on my knees and cried and he in turn did the same and we embraced. None of it made
sense but I was overcome with relief and comfort, the most amazing sense of comfort, more overwhelming than a warm bed on a cold night. And then I saw that I was dead, and I had been forever. I’d never been alive. All this greatness and understanding doesn’t exist because I don’t actually exist. I exist on paper, the paper of my mind, it’s only me that knows I exist. What? Huh? How can that be? I follow myself, my mind, I exist because of that. It’s selfish and I need to do better... You should do better. I love you.</p>
